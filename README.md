# Concordia bigdata project
This is a project for Concordia's Bigdata class (SOEN691 UU) by Dr. Tristan Glatard in Winter 2020.
Team Members:
1. Le, Manh Quoc Dat (Student ID: 40153127)
2. Tran, Trong Tuan (Student ID: 40151694)  
3. Phan, Vu Hong Hai (Student ID: 40154023)

<!--
The team will work on both topics in this project: dataset analysis and algorithm implementation, for tackling of an e-commerce recommedation system's problem. The dataset will be a open one from Kaggle or some other alternative open sources. 

There are some prominent candidate datasets:
1. Elo Merchant Category Recommendation, Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/elo-merchant-category-recommendation
2. Amazon Review Data 2018: https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html
3. Goodreads Book Reviews: https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/ucsdbookgraph/home

Regarding to the algorithms, there are a lot of them and we need choose based on the actual performance of experiments. We will try one method to be mentioned in the class like collaborative filter, plus mightbe one that is not inside the class, and come up with a comparison in evaluation of both methods, with a typical Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) as the indicator.

## Abstract
The data from wearable gadgets (i.e. smart watch) is a reliable source that provide lots of knowledge about substantial range of application such as health monitoring, physical training recommendation. Along with the increasing of quantity of data and quality, the need of getting most out of the data is more and more necessary. However, these data are heterogeneous, noisy, individual driven and sequential-based, which are the key challenger to process. In this project, the main interests of our group are analyzing and building models that can predict people's heart rates based on sequential data from sensors. The dataset is collected from endomondo.com by the authors of [], which contains about 200.000 records of over 1000 users with couple hundred million of sensor measurements and metadata. In the scope of this project, we are developing machine learning models with the main concern about being able to process timeseries big data.
