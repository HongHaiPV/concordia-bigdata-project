# concordia-bigdata-project
This is a project for Concordia's Bigdata class in Winter 2020.
Members are:
1. Le, Manh Quoc Dat (Student ID: 40153127)
2. Tran, Trong Tuan (Student ID: 40151694)  
3. Phan, Vu Hong Hai (Student ID: 40154023)
4. Zhang, Yefei (Student ID: 40153319)

The team will work on both topics in this project: dataset analysis and algorithm implementation for tackling of an e-commerce recommedation system's problem. The dataset will be a open one from Kaggle or some other alternative open sources. 

There are some prominent candidates datasets:
1. Elo Merchant Category Recommendation, Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/elo-merchant-category-recommendation
2. Amazon Review Data 2018: https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html
3. Goodreads Book Reviews: https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/ucsdbookgraph/home

Regarding to the algorithms, there are a lot of them and we need choose based on the actual performance of experiments. We will try one method to be mentioned in the class like collaborative filter, plus mightbe one that is not inside the class, and come up with a comparison in evaluation of both methods, with a typical Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) as the indicator.
